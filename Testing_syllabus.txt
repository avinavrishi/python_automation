STLC - Software testing life cycle
SDLC - Software development life cycle - agile - beta version ---> feedback, devops, waterfall model
Testing methodologies - black box testing, white box model, regression testing

## Pytest Framework
## Selenium for web automtion
## API testing
## - Jenkins or Github lab action

STLC:
1 - Requirement Analysis - to gather the data for the testing purpose like endpoints, payload, output data
2 - Test Planning - 
3 - Test Case development
4 - test environment setup
5 - Test Execution - Defect logging
6 - Test Closure

# Software Requirement (Synopsis)

1- Description of features and functionalities of the target system.
2- Description of the system what do.
3- Requirement Engineering (RE) is refers to the process of defining, documenting and maintaining requirements.

# It is a four step process
1 - Feasibility study
2 - Requirement Gathering/ Elicitation
3 - Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
4 - Software Requirement Validation 
5 - DFD, ER diagram

Tools Support for RE
1 - Observation report (user observation)
2 - Questionnaire (interviews, surveys and polls)
3 - Use Cases
4 - User Stories
5 - Requirement Workshop
6 - Mind Mapping    
7 - Role Playing - Trial and error
8 - Prototyping

# Functional and Non Functional requirements:

Functional - Working
Non Functional - Security, storage, Configuration(keys and password, gitignore), Performance, Cost, Interoperability
                 Disaster Recovery(Exceptional Handling), Accessibilty



Smoke and Sanity testing:

Smoke testing:
1 - Verify the critical functionalities
2 - Intial build 1, 2, 3 working fine?
3 - Main purpose of the smoke testing is to reject a software application with defects so that QA team
    does not waste time testing broken software application.
4 - Smoke testing is done by both developers or tester.
5 - Goal to verify stability.
6 - Smoke testing is a subset of acceptance testing.
7 - Smoke testing is documented or scripted.
8 - Smoke testing verifies the entire system from end to end 
9 - It is like general Health check up.

Sanity Testing
1 - Verify new functionality
2 - After stable build, bugfix? new feature?
3 - Sanity testing is done by tester.
4 - Sanity testing verifies only a particular component.
5 - Sanity testing is a subset of regression testing.
6 - Sanity testing is a specialized health checkup.
